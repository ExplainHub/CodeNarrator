## File Purpose and Functionality

The `writer.js` module provides a function to write markdown content to a specified file within a given output directory.  It handles file path sanitization to prevent issues with invalid characters and ensures the output directory exists before writing the file.  The module uses promises for asynchronous operations.

## Key Functions/Classes

### `writeMarkdown(filePath, content, outputDir)`

This asynchronous function is the core functionality of the module. It takes markdown content and writes it to a file.

**Description:**

The function takes the source file path, markdown content, and output directory as input. It creates a safe filename by removing invalid characters and replacing them with dashes. It then ensures the output directory exists before writing the markdown content to the file with a `.md` extension.  It logs the output path to the console if the `VERBOSE` environment variable is set.

**Inputs:**

* `filePath` (string): The path to the source file.  This is primarily used to generate a safe and descriptive filename for the output file.  The actual file at this path is not read.
* `content` (string): The markdown content to be written to the file.
* `outputDir` (string): The directory where the markdown file will be saved.

**Outputs:**

* `Promise<string>`: A promise that resolves to the path of the generated markdown file.  Rejects with an error if any issues occur during file writing or path creation.

**Error Handling:**

The function includes error handling. If any of the required parameters are missing, it throws an error. If an error occurs during file writing or directory creation, it logs an error message to the console and re-throws the error, allowing the calling function to handle it appropriately.


## Dependencies

* `fs-extra`:  Provides extra file system methods, including `ensureDir` and `writeFile`.  This needs to be installed (`npm install fs-extra`).
* `path`: Node.js built-in module for working with file paths.

## Important Notes and Warnings

* **Error Handling:** The function re-throws errors encountered during file writing.  The calling function should handle these errors appropriately to prevent application crashes.
* **Filename Sanitization:** The function sanitizes filenames to prevent issues with invalid characters.  However, extremely unusual characters might still cause problems.
* **Environment Variable:** The optional verbose logging is controlled by the `VERBOSE` environment variable. Setting `VERBOSE=1` (or any truthy value) will enable verbose output.
* **Relative Paths:** The function uses `path.relative` to generate the filename, making the output path relative to the project's root directory. This helps to avoid hardcoding absolute paths.
* **Overwriting:** If a file with the same name already exists in the output directory, it will be overwritten.  Consider adding error handling or a check for file existence if this behavior is undesirable.


## Example Usage

```javascript
import { writeMarkdown } from './writer.js';

async function generateDocs() {
  try {
    const outputPath = await writeMarkdown('./src/myComponent.js', '# My Component Documentation', './docs');
    console.log("Documentation written successfully to:", outputPath);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating documentation:", error);
  }
}

generateDocs();
```
